# Training Archive

Past training sessions for reference and historical purposes.

## Purpose

This archive serves to:
- Preserve training history
- Provide reference for future sessions
- Track program evolution
- Support new staff onboarding

## Archive Policy

Training materials are moved here when:
- Content becomes outdated (older than 2 years)
- Updated versions are created
- Technology/procedures change significantly

## Organization

Archives are organized by year and topic:
```
archive/
├── 2025/
│   └── [Training folders]
├── 2026/
│   └── [Training folders]
└── ...
```

## Accessing Archive Materials

- Browse by year to find historical sessions
- Check if newer versions exist in `trainings/`
- Use for reference, not as current training material

**Note:** Materials are archived annually during year-end reviews.
